# Reinforcement-Learning-Final-Project


Implemented agent to play Tic Tac Toe.

Random, Epsilon Greedy Q Learning, Q Learning algorithms are used.

The agent can play against human and against another agent.

To execute run: tictactoe_Qlearn.py

In order to select if you want to play against the agent or want the agents to play with themselves choose appropriate line of code by commenting/uncommenting the appropriate line of code at the bottom of the tictactoe_Qlearn.py


The agent comparision can be seen in the Result folder.
